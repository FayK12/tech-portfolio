title: Who Am I?
---

Hello/Salaam/Bienvenue! 

So you want to learn more about me? Well, I'm currently completing my second Bachelor's degree (!!) in Computer Science.
I have studied Biology, Accounting, worked in a global corporate organization, and Toronto hospitals, including Sunnybrook Health Sciences and Women's College Hospital. I've been involved in Executive roles with the Women in Computer Science group, Carleton Computer Science Society, and currently a member of Technolgap.
Personally, my values include my faith, family, and close friends. Good people are hard to find. 
Professionally, I value a culture of growth, respect, communication, and diversity of thought. 
Fun facts: I flew a Cessna near the CN Tower, and bruised my arm a few times in archery club in University
