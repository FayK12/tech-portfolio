title: My vGHC 2020 experience
---

I was fortunate to have the opportunity to attend the Grace Hopper Conference, thanks to funding provided by the Women in Computer Science (WiCS) program at Carleton University. I got to attend the 2019 confernece in person, and virtually attend in 2020. This gives me the opportunity to now compare the two experiences. 


What is GHC ?

The [Grace Hopper Conference](https://ghc.anitab.org/) is an annual conference, and _the world's largest gathering of women in computing_

In 2019, the live conference in Orlando Florida had 26,000 attendees. The conference has many features, including workshops, networking, mentorship, poster presentations, speakers from academic, government, and industry. The live conference has a massive Career Fair where recruiters and engineers amass from companies such as Apple, Facebook, Amazon, Google, JP Morgan, Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, Slack, Home Depot, Microsoft, Salesforce, Stripe, Quora, and **SO MANY MORE COMPANIES**. My live experience in 2019 was unforgetable. But seeing as the 2021 conference will also be 'broadcasted' from Chicago, I'm here to share with you the 2020 virtual experience

What is vGHC ?

vGHC is the virtual Grace Hopper Conference. In the year 2020, the conference, like everything else, was remote because of the COVID-19 pandemic. 

I personally believe that one of the reasons why 2019 was an unforgetable experience was because it was live, in person. The experience of frustration with registration, walking from one end of the hall to the other with feet aching, attending Twitter's after-party or others hosted by companies, signing up for said after-parties or trying to figure out how to receive the exclusive invite to them, meeting fellow students on the bus or walking from hall to hall, meeting Amazon engineers at a Nike after-party, interviewing on site and being treated to lounge beverages, asking students "hey, which booth gave you that ice cream" (it was datto), standing in line for BlackRock's smoothies and learning that the person behind you is an engineer at Apple, these experiences cannot be replicated in the remote environment. 

Also, the cream of the conference, the Career Fair at GHC, was *cancelled* in 2020, mere days before the conference. This was the biggest disappointment from vGHC.

Fun fact, I learned how to create my technical portfolio at the virtual Grace Hopper Celebration
